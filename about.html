								<h2>3 Stages of Transition: Rebellious Teenager, Alumni, and The Quarter Life Crisis</h2>

								<hr />
								<h4>Rebellious Teenager</h4>

								<p>To give you a bit of a personal backstory, I was born and raised in Los Angeles, California. Growing up, I never really had a passion or drive for things in life. As a young teenager, I had no ambitions or goals and all I wanted to do was just these 3 things: Eat, sleep, and play. During my highschool years, I went through a rebellious stage where I would stay out late at night doing activities that teenagers shouldn't do. Eventually, my loving parents, gave me an ultimatum and told me that I needed to find something I wanted to do or get out and survive on my own. This ultimatum was my first transition into adulthood.</p>

								<p>After reflecting, I decided to come up with culinary arts as something I might be interested in pursuing. I mean, I had no choice but to choose so why not do something of the 3 things I already enjoyed doing, eating! I enrolled in a culinary class at my highschool where I was fortunate to meet a mentor who believed in me. After weeks and weeks of practicing, I participated in a culinary competition through a program called C-CAP (Careers Through Culinary Arts Program). Suprisingly, I ended up winning the competition and ended up receiving a full-tuition scholarship to a Culinary School! This is when I realized, I may have chosen something right and my story of life began. </p>

								<hr />

								<h4>Alumni</h4>

								<p>With the full-scholarship, I decided to attend Johnson & Wales University in Providence, Rhode Island, located across the other side of the US. Moving and spending the next 4 years of my young adulthood life in a place where I did not know anyone was truly one of the biggest start to my personal growth.</p>

								<p>For the first two years in college, I continued to learn and become a better cook. During this time, I discovered an additional reason why cooking brought me so much joy. Witnessing my peers enjoying the food that I created in class filled my heart with immense joy and happiness. Being able to connect through food and create a lasting impression was what fueled my desire to continue and become better.</p>

								<p>Before receiving an Associates degree in Culinary Arts, I interned at Walt Disney World's Contemporary Resort at a restaurant, what used to be called "The Contemporary The Wave". The restaurant was located inside the hotel resort and in order for me to get to the restaurant, I had to walk through the lobby of the resort. During this time, I went through another transition.</p>

								<p>Don't get me wrong, I enjoy cooking. I love feeling the rush of being in a busy kitchen with multiple orders coming in at once and firing 5 different dishes at the same time. However, my new found reasoning of why cooking brought me so much joy was not being fulfilled. In the restaurant, there are two terms when referring to the Food & Beverage Department. The "Front Of House" are guest-facing roles such as bartenders, servers, and hosts while "Back Of House" are non-guest-facing roles such as cooks and stewards. As a cook working in the back of the house, I wasn't able see the reactions of the people eating the food that I created. Most people eating at a restaurant do not ask to see the chef who created the food because "the food was so amazing". This led me to change my major to Hotel Management.</p>

								<p>As I mentioned earlier, I walked through the hotel lobby during my internship to get to the restaurant. My shifts were usually during the busy time of check-ins. Seeing that the front desk agents were making guests smile, I wanted to do the same. I made the decision to switch to the front of the house and pursue a career in Hotel Management. I ended up graduating with a Bachelors in Hotel Management and Lodging.</p>

								<h4>Alumni - Part 2</h4>

								<p>Fast forward, after graduating college, I ended up working as an Assistant General Manager in Training at Extended Stay America in Ohio, and came back home to Los Angeles to work as a front desk agent/night-auditor and accounts receivable. After couple of years, in 2020, the pandemic came around and I was laid off due to budget cuts. Due to the hospitality industry getting hit the hardest, I was forced to go through another transition and I needed to make a decision: wait until the pandemic ended or find another career path.</p>

								<p>Not knowing when the pandemic would end, I took the time to decide what my career path would be. I wanted to continue providing excellent service and bringing joy to people so I chose to become a real estate agent as it was the best option to do so. I obtained my real estate license and started my new career journey.</p>

								<hr />

								<h4>The Quarter Life Crisis</h4>

								<p>Have you heard of the phrase quarter life crisis? If you haven't, let me tell you about it.</p>

								<p>A quarter-life crisis is a crisis "involving anxiety over the direction and quality of one's life". You experience it usually between the early twenties up to your mid-thirties. For me, the hardest part of the quarter-life crisis experience was the fact that I ended up in this loop of trying to figure out the meaning of life and what my purpose in life was. It was a time of reflection and a time to really dig deep into my past, present, and future. </p>

								<p>During my time as a real estate agent, I started to lose sight of my reasoning and what my purpose was. I started to lose motivation and got into a bad habit of waking up late and not being productive. After about a year and half in the business, I was very fortunate to meet another person who cared for me. She told me that I should find what I really wanted to do. This led me to take a step back in life, pause, sit down and go soul-searching once more.</p>

								<p>During this time, I found a hidden interest in computer science which sparked a curiosity in web/app development from my love for playing games. I decided to self-study for about 6-months learning basic HTML/CSS and JavaScript before making the decision to attend a 24-Week Immersive Web Development Bootcamp with App Academy.</p>

								<p>After 1000+ hours of coding and learning and graduating in July 2023, I am glad to say that I am now a software engineer!</p>

								<hr />

								<h4>The End Of Transition And My Commitment</h4>

								<p>During these transitions throughout my life, I learned many valuable skills and grew as a person. From the many changes, I became very adaptable to new situations and circumstances, became a better problem-solver, worked with many teams which taught me how to be a team-player, and much more. There is a reason for everything that happens in life. You live and you learn and you embrace changes and hardships. You learn from mistakes, make your weaknesses into strengths, and make your strengths into assets.</p>

								<p>The commitment I have made to myself is to continue to learn and grow as a person and as a Software Developer and continue to help others while making an impact in this world through the usage of technology. </p>
